# Ferry Ticket Demand Forecasting

This project forecasts short-term ferry ticket demand (15m–2h horizons) using machine learning and time-series models.  
It includes an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for visualization and model comparison.

## Features
- Baseline models (Naïve, Moving Average, Linear Regression)
- Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Time-Series models (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Forecast uncertainty visualization
- KPI tracking:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - Peak Miss Rate
  - Confidence Band Width
  - Forecast Lead Time
